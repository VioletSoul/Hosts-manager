A compact Bash module for reading, permission checking, and backing up the hosts file on your macOS when needed.
The script is adapted for the Zsh shell.

Please make sure that the script file is executable by running:

Then, you can run it using:
'./hosts_manager_2.sh'

This will ensure the script has the necessary permissions to execute properly.
