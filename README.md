A compact Bash module for reading, permission checking, and backing up the hosts file on your macOS when needed.
The script is adapted for the Zsh shell.
Support for adding/removing records, selecting a backup, checking syntax (IPv4 and IPv6), searching for duplicate IP-hostname pairs, export/import and rights management.

Please make sure that the script file is executable by running:
'chmod +x hosts_manager_2.sh'

Then, you can run it using:
'./hosts_manager_2.sh'

This will ensure the script has the necessary permissions to execute properly.
